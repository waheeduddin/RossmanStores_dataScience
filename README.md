# RossmanStores_dataScience
a repository to showcase the solution of the test fror intern <br>
The main file is solution.ipynb.that alone is sufficeint for the project. ### The 'Train.csv' is missing from this upload becasue it was too large <br>
besides the file, the two models that were computed are uploaded for every one to study <br>
A 'model_loader' file is created as well for anyone to play around after loading the models. <br>

# Notes:
The random forest model file '.sav' was not uploaded becasue of its size <br>
I was unable to make a seperate class for the helper functions <br>
I tried the results of many models, the best and in time constructed model is part of the solution fille and uploaded <br>
