# RossmanStores_dataScience
a repository to showcase the solution of data science problems with respect ot time series data <br>
The main file is 'solution.ipynb' .that alone is sufficeint for the project. <br>
##### The 'Train.csv' and 'randomForest_model' file is missing from this upload becasue it was too large <br>
besides the file, the two models that were computed are uploaded for every one to study <br>
A 'model_loader' file can be created as well to reuse models. <br>

# Notes:
rmspe in Random Forest on training set: 0.925059452334956 <br>
The random forest model file '.sav' was not uploaded becasue of its size <br>
I was unable to make a seperate class for the helper functions <br>
I tried the results of many models, the best and in time constructed model is part of the solution fille and uploaded <br>
In the future a time series analysis could be done just as I have demonstrated here <br>
